# Flood-Fill-Algorithm-Visualizer
Implementation of the Flood Fill Algorithm utilizing JavaFX for a graphical user interface

IMPORTANT NOTE: JavaFX must be downloaded in order to run the program. I recommend using IntelliJ IDEA and selecting JavaFX when creating a new project.

This project primarily served as an opportunity for me to learn about a well-known algorithm while learning how to create GUIs in Java.

The algorithm I referenced can be found on the following link: https://www.techiedelight.com/flood-fill-algorithm/
It uses a breadth-first search technique to traverse adjacent nodes.

GUI instructions:
  1. select a color among the radio buttons on the top panel
  2. Click one cell/tile on the grid that contains a different color than the one selected.
  3. Watch the algorithm progressively fill the region of colors to the new color.
